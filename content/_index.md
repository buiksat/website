The **Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab** (RLsquared) conducts research on models and algorithms for *reinforcement learning* and *data-driven decision making*. 

We want to deliver real-world impacts through reinforcement learning by designing methods that practitioners can use out-of-the-box. 

We are current working on these topics:

* Robust reinforcement learning 
* Robust optimization 
* Presence-only data
* Interpretable reinforcement learning
* Value function and model approximation techniques

Our current applications are:

* Management of invasive species with [Jenica Allen](https://colsa.unh.edu/faculty/allen)
* Data-driven pest management in agriculture with [Shadi Atallah](https://colsa.unh.edu/faculty/atallah)
* Active learning for image recognition with 
* Autonomous control of marine vessels
