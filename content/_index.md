The **Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab** (RLsquared) conducts research on models and algorithms for *reinforcement learning* and *data-driven decision making*. 

We want to deliver real-world impacts through reinforcement learning by designing methods that practitioners can use out-of-the-box. 

We are current working on these topics:

* Robust reinforcement learning and optimization
* Exploration in reinforcement learning
* Fast mathematical optimization
* Interpretable reinforcement learning
* Value function and model approximation techniques

Our current applications are:

* Management of invasive species with [Jenica Allen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fSoN2iYAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Data-driven pest management in agriculture with [Shadi Atallah](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/shadi-s-atallah)
* [Machine learning for magnetosphere](https://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/) with [Matthew Argall](https://mypages.unh.edu/argallmr/bio)
* And others
