The **Reinforcement Learning and Robustness Lab** (RLsquared) conducts research on models and algorithms for reinforcement learning. Our long-term goal is to achieve real-world impacts through reinforcement learning. We want to achieve this goal by designing a new class of reliable methods that work of out-of-the-box and can be used easily to domain experts and practitioners. Some of the topics that we are working on currently are:

* Robust reinforcement learning for data-limited problems
* Interpretable reinforcement learning
* Value function and model approximation techniques

We are also collaborating with domain experts in areas that include management of invasive species, agriculture, and oceanography.
